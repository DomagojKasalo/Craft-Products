# Craft Products Showcase Platform

## Overview
This application is a dynamic platform designed for showcasing a variety of craft products. 
It facilitates the exploration and management of craft items such as beer, wine, chocolate, and pizza, providing detailed information about each product and its manufacturer. 
The project is structured into a client-side application developed in React and a server-side API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Key Features
* **Dynamic Product Display:** Products are displayed with essential details, with options for sorting and filtering based on manufacturers.
* **Detailed Product and Manufacturer Information:** Each product page offers detailed descriptions, characteristics (e.g., alcohol percentage, type), and manufacturer history.
* **Secure User Authentication:** Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and session management.
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiates between regular users and administrators, allowing only administrators to perform CRUD operations on products and manufacturers.
* **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface built with React, offering seamless navigation and interaction.
  
## Technology Stack
* ### Frontend:
  * React: For building the dynamic and responsive user interface.
  * SCSS: Used for styling the application with more advanced features than regular CSS.
  * React Router: For handling in-app routing and navigation.
* ### Backend:
  * Node.js: The runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server.
  * Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, simplifying API creation.
  * MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing application data.
  * Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
* ### Authentication:
  * JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For securing routes and managing user sessions.

This project showcases a comprehensive application of modern web development technologies to create a functional and secure platform for craft product enthusiasts.
